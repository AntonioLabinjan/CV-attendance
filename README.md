## Project Overview

This Face Recognition Attendance System enables automated attendance tracking using face recognition technology. It captures live video from a webcam, detects faces, recognizes them, and logs attendance in an SQLite database. The system features a simple web interface for monitoring and viewing attendance records.

### Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Uses Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time from webcam feed.
- **Face Recognition**: Utilizes the CLIP model from Hugging Face to recognize and match faces.
- **Attendance Logging**: Logs each student's attendance in an SQLite database, ensuring that each student is only logged once per session.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a web-based interface to view the live camera feed and attendance records.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. **Pip**: Ensure you have pip for installing Python packages.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-attendance.git
   cd face-recognition-attendance
   
2. **Create and activate VEnv** (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Install dependecies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Set up database**
The database will be automatically created on the first run. Ensure attendance.db is writable by the application.

6. **Prepare known faces**
Place student images in the known_faces directory, organized by student folders.
